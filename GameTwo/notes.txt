If the xoffset + image width exceeds canvas bounds.....
- only want to process to the canvas bounds
	- the image has a 'clipped' width

getTileWidth()
getWidth()

Both work for ImageTiles but they really shouldnt. Unless I discover something later this NEEDS to be fixed
- no this is fine but weird. 






Audio: The way the tutorial constructed the decode format confused me and made little sense. However when I tried to do it logically it didnt work. 
- I would have thought that to decode we would have used all base format attributes. While I guess that isnt logical, the way the tutorial slammed in channels * 2 into the frame size parameter, and used sample rate for frame rate...? didnt make sense. Also the tutorial used 16 for the bit rate however the original file had a bit rate of 24. 

Using tutorial setting on ding noise: worked
	Base format sample rate: 48000.0
	Base format sample size in bits: 24
	Base format channels: 1
	Base format frame size: 3
	Base format frame rate: 48000.0
	Decode format sample rate: 48000.0
	Decode format sample size in bits: 16
	Decode format channels: 1
	Decode format frame size: 2
	Decode format frame rate: 48000.0

Using 24 for bit rate rather then 16: (ding) didnt work
Base format sample rate: 48000.0
Base format sample size in bits: 24
Base format channels: 1
Base format frame size: 3
Base format frame rate: 48000.0
Decode format sample rate: 48000.0
Decode format sample size in bits: 24
Decode format channels: 1
Decode format frame size: 2
Decode format frame rate: 48000.0


Using base formats Frame size instead of baseFormat channels*2: didnt work
- crashed when tried to decode to AudioInputStream


What I have found out: 
- If the stream is encoded in PCM format (it is), and is not compressed, a frame contains the samples for each channel, for one time index. 

- 	Sample rate = number of samples / second

	Frame = 1 sample from each channel (PCM)

	Frame Size = Sample size * Channels

	Frame Rate = frames / second.

	For PCM the sample rate and the frame rate are the same since a frame consists of a a sample from each channel
