How can we make PathFinding Faster


Dont look at paths longer then the shortest currently found path: 
- DONE see below




Further restrict search area
- have changed search area min and max to +/-3 Tiles from NPC and target location, this may be too small for more complex enviroments




Dont even bother searching for path if the location is unreachable (inside a tile), too high in the air
- only path find to locations the game has determined is reachable...
- dont pathfind to impossible locations, easy with solid tiles, hard if in air
- maybe if location is illegal, try move up out of solid tile or move downb out of the air to a reachable location...
- or just have a rule that a location has to be ontop of a solid tile and not 
	- but a 1 tile hole surronded by solids would generate worst case, this is an easy fix but a bit iffy...
	
	
	
A* ... I think this would be a good idea to make the debugging erasier. Right now even a small path search results in a lot of redundant searching. 
- in the worst case we will still get this BUT at least there wouldnt be 1 million print statements to filter through

Before:

 Time taken to Path Find: 57308800
Target Location: TileX = 3, TileY = 3
PathLength: 27
Average Duration over 100 tests:  37128329


After
 Time taken to Path Find: 40800
Target Location: TileX = 3, TileY = 3
PathLength: 27
Average Duration over 100 tests:  75028


Just after doing this im am pretty satisifed with this speed. It is not generally noticable. 
- there will be cases when it is noticable but I could make sure these cases arent allowed to happen
	- e.g limit path finding distance
	 	- or perform multiple smaller path finds 

1400 times faster in the general case
- however in worst case, e.g there is no path, just the same
