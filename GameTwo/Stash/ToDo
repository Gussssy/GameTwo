PathFinding: 
[DONE]- fix inability to path over two high tile stack
- fix airmoves and down + horizontal moves when not on ground
- find a way for NPCs to choose locations to path to automatically
	- thinking maybe game will hold a an array of reachable position that the NPCs can choose from
- implement A* like behaviour
- determine worst case and make saure that time is below 1/60th of a second
[50%~!]- finish path execution to a basic level
- allow jumping over 2 wide holes 
LATER
- advanced pathfinding, jump over a several tiles, staying within a certain tolerance and coninuting path execution
- detect when NPC has deviated from path and needs to go back (will be important when NPCs can be pushed around)
- pathfinding that takes into account platforms
- pathfinding that takes into account moving platforms


NPC Combat (impt)
- NPCs aware of other NPCs/player around them
- NPCs can use weapons
- NPCs attack other NPCs
- NPCs actually die when reduced to 0 HP



Rework of Weapon System
- abaility to interchange weapons 
- common abstract classes for weapons that are extended (weapons as components? this does seem to make sense)
- Sword/meelee weapon


UI
- Inventory / tab menu
- stats menu
- HUD - health


Interaction / Activation 
- Event system when pressing 'e' when near something, something happens, e.g board ship


Menu Screen and Game Screen
- play state and menu state 
- menu screen
- something cool in background of pain menu
- pause screen
- options screen / panel accessible in game (from the menu too at some point but not a biggy)

Saving
- a away to save game progress










Dev Diary 
 - video entry showing path finding as it is, what it cant do (e.g jump over two wide gaps) (will have to design a map for this)
 - just get it on GitHub - Thursday 27th.
