The 4 day weekend: 

Collision Detection: not fixed yet but the fix is pretty much ready to go when i can be bothered


Path Finding: Early days but works. Can fins simple paths. As of yet NPCs cannot execute a path. 
 - finding a path: sort of works, needs to be made better, maybe the first thing to do is enable direction selection but in worst cases this will achive nothing
 - follwing a path: havent started
 - automatic target location selection and pathfinding of npcs: should be easy 
 - stress testing with multiple botbots: cant wait for this
 
 Fighting:
 - detection of enemies
 - NPC bullet firing
 - NPC combat bevahior.. jumping? random left rights...? 
 - actual dying of NPCs
 
 A different weapon
 - make a weapon a property of a GameObject and the projectile fired depends on the weapon
 	- projectile firing will be done by weapon class/subclass, not by the GameObject class
 
 Last Thing for the weekend: 
 - BotBot arena battle
